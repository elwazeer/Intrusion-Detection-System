# Intrusion-Detection-System

The project is mainly composed of machine learning models tested on NSL-KDD and Kyoto+ datasets aiming to build an ensemble model selecting
among SVM, ANN, Random Forest and KNN classifiers.

The ensemble model is proceeded by Data preporcessing and cleaning, and Feature selection process before being tested on each classifier alone
